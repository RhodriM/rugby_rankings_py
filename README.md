## Rugby Rankings

Python library for calculating rugby ranking points.

This library is a Python version of [php rugby rankings](https://github.com/RhodriM/rugbyRankings). The php library was itself an exercise in OO, tools etc; therefore some code may be slightly over-OOP-engineered - especially for Python. As a newcomer to Python I have tried to do things 'the Python way', even where it goes against my OOP/Java-ish instincts, but if there are any obvious cases in this repo of where something could be done better in Python please let me know.
